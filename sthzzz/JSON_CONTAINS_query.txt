Assuming that bookingfrom AND bookingtill are DATE fields:

SELECT * 
FROM booking 
WHERE userid='67' 
AND '".date('Y-m-d', strtotime($date))."' BETWEEN bookingfrom AND bookingtill
AND service='test'
AND status='0'

With "date('Y-m-d', strtotime($date))" you set the format to make comparison in MySql.

SELECT * FROM booking WHERE userid='67' AND bookingfrom <= $data AND bookingtill >= $data AND service='test' AND status='0'


SELECT * FROM `inv_products` WHERE DATE('2013-03-22') BETWEEN mfg_year AND exp_year;

(date_end >= CURRENT_DATE() OR date_end IS NULL)

SELECT * FROM `inv_products` WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2012-11-21') BETWEEN mfg_year AND IF(exp_year IS NOT NULL, exp_year, YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()));

SELECT * FROM `inv_products` WHERE '2012' BETWEEN mfg_year AND IF(exp_year IS NOT NULL, exp_year, YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()));

SELECT * FROM `inv_products` WHERE JSON_CONTAINS(vehicle_model, '3', '$') AND '2012' BETWEEN mfg_year AND IF(exp_year IS NOT NULL, exp_year, YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()));
