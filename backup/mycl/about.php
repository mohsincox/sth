                <div class="icon linearicons-cloud-sync"></div>
                <h6 class="title">Cloud Service</h6>
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Earlier we used to store our data in hard drives on a computer. Cloud Computing services have replaced such hard drive technology. Cloud Computing service is nothing but providing services like Storage, Databases, Servers, networking and the software through the Internet. MYCL is offering Cloud Service e.g. AWS, Azure & Oracle Cloud Solution.</p>
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Generally, MYCL cloud computing services are categorized into three types.</p>

                
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><b>1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b> This service provides the infrastructure like Servers, Operating Systems, Virtual Machines, Networks, and Storage on rent basis.</p>
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">E.g: Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure</p>
                
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/aws.png" alt="" >
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/microsoft-azure.png" alt="">
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><b>2) Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b> This service is used in developing, testing and maintaining of software. PaaS is same as IaaS but also provides additional tools like DBMS and BI service.</p>
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Eg: Apprenda, Red Hat OpenShift, Oracle Cloud</p>
                
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/oracle-cloud.jpg" alt="" >
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/vmware.jpg" alt="">
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><b>3) Software as a Service (SaaS):</b> This service makes the users connect to the applications through the Internet on a subscription basis.</p>
                <p style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Eg: Google Applications, Salesforce, Oracle Cloud</p>
